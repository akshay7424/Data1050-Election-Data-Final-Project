                <p >The project explores the potential success of startup companies in the
            U.S. by examining key features that economically and financially impact
            these companies. Currently, venture capital firms use intuition, financial
            projections, and personal connections to determine which companies receive
            seed money. Understandably, there is high risk and uncertainty associated
            with venture capital where only a handful of companies become unicorns (>
            $1bn valuation) with successful exits. The goal of this machine learning
            project is to shed some light into what variables contribute to a
            companyâ€™s success, outside of financials, to reduce the randomness and
            personal bias in venture capital investment.</p>
